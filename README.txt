Note: Perform the following operations before running the program

Step 1: First open phpmyAdmin, and import the database 'food_delivery.sql'
Step 2: Now, in the Login_fds.java and Register_fds.java change 
      String password = "KING997767" to String password = "your_database_password"

Note: your_database_password should be the password to your mysql root account

I made sure the fields of the registration form are not empty except the middle name.
Meaning you can leave the middle field empty.
